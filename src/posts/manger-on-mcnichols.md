LMAO today sucked ass. I spent damn near two hours trying to figure out why my Github SSH keys weren't working. I guess the automatically delete themselves after some time of not being in use. 

In the end, I got that working and them I spend another hour of trying to figure out how to get Decap working. 

For those who don't know, Decap is a rebranded version of Netlify CMS. I never used Netlify CMS purely based on the fact that it looked ugly. Either I haven't used it in a long ass time or the maintainer of Decap did something right to make it not look like ass because I'm digging it now. 

I've been on the hunt for a Forestry replacement. It's crazy because Forestry was the perfect CMS for SSG's. But that site has sunsetted and the TinaCMS has replaced it. I might try Tina one day, but as of right now, Decap seems to be doing what I need a CMS to do. 

One big thing that I like so far is that you can add drafts. IDK if that feature was present when it was Netlify CMS but it's a feature that I'm glad to have. 

Right now, I need to figure out how to get the `_data` folder working with `config.yml`.

I won't lie, even before the rebrand, I was pretty intimidated by Netlify CMS. That was because of how complex config.yml can get, but I am convinced that documentation will show you the most complicated example of their product right of the bat. IDK why. After seeing some videos, I noticed that I was afraid of nothing. I'll admit that. Basically, part of the configuration is for the UI, and the other part is for the fields that the user will be typing in. 

Also, shout-out to Decap having a rich text editor. IDK if that's new or a remnant from Netlify. Either way, I'm for it. 

That's all I got for now. Peace.
